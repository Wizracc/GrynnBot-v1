# GrynnBot-v1
GrynnBot is a discord bot that sends notifications to discord servers when a twitch streamer comes online. This was a personal project coded in Python using Discord.py as a basis. Functionality was prioritized over elegant code in some instances.

GrynnBot is likely going to be rewritten (perhaps in another language) and given a nice website and host that isn't my raspberry pi at home.
